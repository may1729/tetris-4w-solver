  """Computes best next board state.

  First, attempts to minimize number of placements over the next `len(queue) - 1` pieces that do not clear a line.
  Among those, minimizes the number of minos on the board.

  Returns a tuple with the piece used and the next board hash.

  `board_hash` is the hash of the input board.

  `queue` is a string containing the hold piece followed by the next pieces.

  `foresight` is the length of the foresight queue.
  This is used to compute the probability that the next `foresight` pieces will force a non line clear.
  This is then accounted for when selecting a continuation.

  If `can180` is False, then excludes all 180 finesse.

  If `canHold` is False, then assumes that the hold queue is empty and disallows access to it.

  If `build_up_now` is True, then will prioritize upstacking to target number of minos over not breaking.

  `well_height` is the amount of garbage to add underneath the stack whenever a piece is placed that does not clear a line.

  If `canHold` is False, then assumes that the hold queue is empty and disallows access to it.

  `tc_cache_filename` is the file name of the transition cache to load or save from.
  If `tc_cache_filename` is None, will not save the cache at the end.

  `starting_state` is the hash of the intial board state.
