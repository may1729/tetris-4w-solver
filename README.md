# tetris-4w-solver
Programs to compute optimal solutions to maximize various objectives in 4w mode.

Used in https://github.com/trueharuu/6res in the tetr.io bot [6res!](https://ch.tetr.io/u/6res)

## Todo:
- Create algorithms to optimize for minimum pieces per PC.
- Tweak board state evaluation to prefer 6res states.
- Fix spin detection algorithm, as it misses some edge cases.
- Redo kick reading and data input functions to use not custom input files.
